Key points:
â€¢ Must contain unique values
â€¢ Cannot contain NULL values
â€¢ Each table can have only ONE primary key
â€¢ Often used with AUTO_INCREMENT to generate unique IDs

Example:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    email TEXT
);""",

Key points:
â€¢ Ensures referential integrity
â€¢ Links tables together
â€¢ Prevents orphaned records
â€¢ Can have multiple foreign keys in a table

Example:
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    amount FLOAT
);""",

Types of JOINs:
â€¢ INNER JOIN: Returns matching rows from both tables
â€¢ LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from left table, matching rows from right
â€¢ RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from right table, matching rows from left
â€¢ FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables

Example:
SELECT u.name, o.amount
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;""",

Basic syntax:
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

Advanced features:
â€¢ WHERE: Filter rows
â€¢ ORDER BY: Sort results
â€¢ GROUP BY: Group rows
â€¢ LIMIT: Limit number of results
â€¢ DISTINCT: Remove duplicates

Example:
SELECT name, age 
FROM users 
WHERE age > 18 
ORDER BY name 
LIMIT 10;""",

Syntax:
INSERT INTO table_name (col1, col2) VALUES (val1, val2);

You can:
â€¢ Insert specific columns
â€¢ Insert multiple rows at once
â€¢ Insert all columns without specifying names

Example:
INSERT INTO users (id, name, email) 
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com');""",

Syntax:
UPDATE table_name SET col1 = val1 WHERE condition;

Important:
â€¢ Always use WHERE clause to specify which rows to update
â€¢ Without WHERE, ALL rows will be updated!

Example:
UPDATE users 
SET email = 'newemail@example.com' 
WHERE id = 1;""",
    
    "delete": """DELETE removes rows from a table.

Syntax:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Important:
â€¢ Always use WHERE clause to specify which rows to delete
â€¢ Without WHERE, ALL rows will be deleted!

Example:
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;""",

Syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (

    column2 type constraints

Common constraints:
â€¢ PRIMARY KEY
â€¢ NOT NULL
â€¢ REFERENCES (foreign key)

Example:
CREATE TABLE users (

    age INT
);""",

Operators:
â€¢ = (equal)
â€¢ != (not equal)

Example:
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE age >= 18 AND age <= 65;""",

Common with:
â€¢ COUNT()
â€¢ SUM()
â€¢ AVG()
â€¢ MAX()
â€¢ MIN()

Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as total
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;""",

Syntax:
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC];
